# WeatherVoyager

WeatherVoyager is a sophisticated web application designed to help travelers find destinations with their ideal weather conditions. By selecting your preferred weather parameters through an intuitive interface, our advanced matching algorithm analyzes both current and forecasted weather data to recommend destinations that best match your unique preferences. The system adapts to your choices, scoring each city based on how closely it matches your desired conditions for truly personalized travel recommendations.

## Weather Profiles & Intelligent Recommendations

WeatherVoyager features a smart weather preference system with predefined weather profiles:

- **Hot and Dry**: 28-40°C (82-104°F) with low humidity and no rain
- **Warm and Sunny**: 21-28°C (70-82°F) with low humidity and no rain
- **Cold and Snowy**: -10-5°C (14-41°F) with high humidity and snow
- **Mild and Rainy**: 15-25°C (59-77°F) with high humidity and rain
- **Cool and Humid**: 10-20°C (50-68°F) with high humidity and occasional rain
- **Balanced**: 18-28°C (64-82°F) with moderate humidity and occasional rain

The system automatically resolves conflicts between incompatible preferences (e.g., "Hot and Dry" conflicts with "Cold and Snowy") and suggests appropriate temperature ranges based on your selections.

## Weather Standards & Definitions

WeatherVoyager uses internationally recognized meteorological standards:

**Extreme Weather Thresholds:**

- Extreme hot: temperature > 35°C (95°F)
- Extreme cold: temperature < 0°C (32°F)
- Heavy rain: precipitation ≥ 1.5 mm per hour (about 4.5 mm in 3h)
- Strong wind: wind speed ≥ 40 km/h (11 m/s)
- High humidity: humidity ≥ 85%

**Normal Weather Ranges:**

- Temperature: 15°C to 30°C (59°F to 86°F)
- Precipitation: < 1.5 mm per hour
- Wind: < 28 km/h (8 m/s)
- Humidity: 30%–70%

## How Our Matching Algorithm Works

When you submit your weather preferences, WeatherVoyager:

1. **Analyzes Current & Forecast Data**: For each city, we check both current weather and the upcoming 5-day forecast
2. **Applies Weather Profiles**: Uses your selected profiles (Hot & Dry, Warm & Sunny, etc.) to customize search parameters
3. **Scores Each City**: Cities are scored based on how closely they match your preferences using a sophisticated weighting system
4. **Considers Seasonal Factors**: Adjusts scores based on current season and climate zones
5. **Ranks & Recommends**: Cities are ranked by their match score, with the best matches displayed first

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap 5
- **Backend**: PHP
- **Weather Data**: OpenWeather API
- **Maps**: Leaflet.js for interactive mapping
- **Image API**: Pexels API for city images
- **News Integration**: Dynamic weather news aggregation
- **Storage**: Browser local storage for favorites
- **URL Handling**: Clean URLs via .htaccess rewrites
